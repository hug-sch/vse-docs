User Preferences
================

In the User Preferences editor you can set the default look-and-feel of blender. All Blender defaults are described in detail in the `editor section <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/preferences/introduction.html>`_. The editor is accessible with the menu Edit > Preferences.

We have listed all settings that apply to the Video Sequence Editor or could be useful in the video editing task in table 1. If appropriate, we added a link to some additional info in the VSE docs.
