Edit your sound
===============

A picture is a thousand words ... but a good sound is even worth more. The Sound support for audio and sound is somewhat underpowered. Blender is in first instance a visual package. However, you can perform the basic audio tasks in Blender as well. And above that, a good integration with `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/>`_ is possible. See for example the addon by TinTwoTin & TonTon: github.com/tin2tin/audacity_tools_for_blender. 
You'll need a cutting edge Audacity build from here to get the playback working: github.com/audacity/audacity/actions
