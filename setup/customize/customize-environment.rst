Blender has a dedicated workspace environment for video editing. But, of course in the tradition of a truly open-source package, you can customize this completely. From rearranging windows to reassigning short-cut keys.

Another benefit of the open-source culture is the existence of a huge contributing community. Lots of addons are created for specific use-cases Other add-ons fill in the still missing parts of the core Video Sequencer.
