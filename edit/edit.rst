There is no single optimal workflow for editing your video projects that fits every case. In :doc:`Specific workflows </workflow/workflow>` we describe some use cases; e.g. tutorial editing, wedding videos, ...  In this section, we distinguish 4 basic activities. But first, we cover some timeline basics such as zooming, navigating, and selecting.

* Assembling the timeline: starting with your raw footage, you'll have to deliver a coherent and fluent succession of strips that tell your story. Clips have to be rearranged, combined, cut and trimmed.
* Introducing special effects: these can be simple transition effects between strips, e.g. fade or full-fledged animations, e.g. rolling end credits.
* Introducing sound: this ranges from adding background music and voice-over to creating special sound effects and using third-party software such as Audacity.
* Color grading: because your assembled timeline consists of different shots taken with different cameras under different lighting conditions, colors can vary widely between them. With color grading and color correcting you can harmonize your colors in the timeline.
